## Variables
Variables are useful with many operations,
###Variable Declaration
Variables are declared by creating an identifier and a following equal sign. The value you want goes after the equal sign.
```
a = 12          //Variable a is assigned the value 12
b = a + 5       //Variable b is assigned the value 17
x = y = z = 9   //Variables x, y, and z are assigned the value 9

```
###Variable operations
Variables have operations that can be used to modify their values
```
c = 90
c += 25         //Variable c is now 125
d = 2
x = 45 + d += 20 //Variable d is now 32 and x is 67
```
